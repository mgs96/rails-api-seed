# README

The idea of this project is to serve as an API seed project, I will add further
info... later

if you're using [c9.io](https://c9.io/) and you want to upload it to heroku,
chances are you have a legacy heroku-cli, to solve this, copy-paste the
following in the terminal:
```sh
wget -qO- https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh
```
this should update the heroku-cli
